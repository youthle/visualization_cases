# Visualization Cases
## Welcome to Zhouyayan (Iris)'s data visualization repository!
Webpage link:
This repository includes some visualization work by Zhouyayan (Iris) Li. These cases involve a variety of spatial and temporal datasets, including housing data from the United States Census Bureau and global economic and air quality data from the World Bank. The main tools for creating those visualization projects are D3.js, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Observable.

On the comprehensive project page, you will also find a detailed report I did with the aim of providing a preliminary analysis to find the relationship between global GDP growth and air quality changes over years.

Feel free to reach out to me (zhouyayan.li@gmail.com) if you have any questions!
